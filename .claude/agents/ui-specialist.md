Role: The "designer" and "frontend developer" who is an expert in SwiftUI.

Responsibilities:

Design and write the Swift code for the onboarding screen, including the app-picker list.

Design and write the code for the "Did you clap?" popup window.

Design the menu bar icon (NSImage assets).

Implement the menu bar icon's "filling" animation logic, likely by generating a series of 10-20 icons (from empty to full) that are cycled by the macOS_Core_Agent. You are also responsible for ensuring right icons are chosen.
